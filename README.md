# MedAssist: AI-Powered Automated Nurse System

## üè• Overview

MedAssist is an AI-powered automated nurse system designed to streamline communication between patients and healthcare providers. The system addresses critical challenges in healthcare delivery including nursing shortages, emergency room inefficiencies, and communication gaps between patients and medical staff.

### The Problem

The healthcare industry faces:
- Critical nursing shortages leading to burnout and reduced quality of care
- Long emergency room wait times and inefficient patient processing
- Communication barriers between patients and healthcare providers
- Patients struggling to articulate symptoms effectively
- Patients often misunderstanding or forgetting treatment details

### Our Solution

MedAssist serves as an automated communication interface that:
- Enables patients to describe their conditions through natural conversation
- Extracts critical medical information and classifies patient severity
- Forwards structured patient data to doctors before arrival
- Records and summarizes doctor-patient interactions
- Generates personalized treatment summaries, recovery timelines, and medication reminders

## ‚ú® Features

- Email and notification systems

## üìä Dataset

This project utilizes the [augmented-clinical-notes dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGBonnet/augmented-clinical-notes) from Hugging Face, which provides:
- Medical conversations between healthcare providers and patients
- Clinical notes from medical professionals
- Summarized medical information

## üìã Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate our system using:
- **ROUGE scores** for measuring textual overlap
- **BERTScore** for assessing semantic similarity
- **F1 scores** for structured component accuracy
- **Exact match accuracy** for critical medical fields

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the backend server
python server.py

# In a new terminal, start the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
